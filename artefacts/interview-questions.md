### questions for the interviewee

* can you tell us a bit about yourself and your organization, what is your expertise?

* what is/has been your role in OpenZaak, is it documented, do you have mandate?
* how did you get involved, how did you enter the ecosystem?
* how do you work together, what is the process, which other parties do you collaborate with?
* how does that work for you, what works well, what would you recommend other components reuse (and what not)
* have there been notable changes in the openzaak ecosystem over time, good or bad?
* how do you see the future of OpenZaak? Is it mostly development and new features? Or is it scaling implementations and new users?
* are there any improvements you can think of, what needs to improve (pain points/blockers)?
* what would be the best future you can think of (ambitions/wishes)?
* biggest challenge you see for the community (getting there)?
